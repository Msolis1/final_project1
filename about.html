<p class="frame">Hello, I want to tell you a little about myself. Growing up I spent a lot of time outside, whether it was sports at my local rec center, working in the fields some summers with my father and playing with the neighborhood kids. Unfortunately as I got older I took on more and more responsibilities; Eventually adulting caught up to me. I found myself occupied between school, work and family. As cliche as it sounds I decided to figure out who I was outside of the titles of mom, daughter, wife and friend. I knew it was between crafting or doign outdoors activities. So I kept both and decided to split my time between them. finding that balance of sittingand crafting for hours and bieng outside active for hours. its all about balance! <br>
  One of my first and most memorable hikes was to Upper Yosemite Falls. It's insane to think Yosemite is near and I experienced that as an adult 15 years ago.  Iâ€™m a firm believer that there is a trail for all of us - no matter the age, size, gender expression, or health issues. The benefits of spending time in Nature are tremendous, and I hope more people gain access to them.
