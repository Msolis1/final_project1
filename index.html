        <h1> A Hike for Every Age</h1>
        <header class="frame">
          <p>Hola, If you’re interested in hiking but don’t have a lot of experience, it can be a little overwhelming. I want this page to be a resource for those who desire to start. Regardless of ability and skill level, we are here to guide you in the right direction. There are so many mental and physical health benefits of hiking and being active. Simple acts like taking a walk around your neighborhood, getting some sun, meditating and being mindful can alter your brain structure to improve your health. I encourage you to venture out a little. <br>
            Here are some great tips on planning amazing hiking trips, with family These next four hiking spots are some of my son's favorites. Skill level is easy enough that I took my son at the ages of 4-7. Most helpful tip with taking younger kids is having a game plan. Teaching them to respect the outdoors. Playing fun games on the trail, scanning the landscape for certain flowers, different animals/insects, counting, singing, picking up trash, pack an extra baggy and a glove. My sons all time favorite is “I spy with my little eye…”. Taking the young ones on day trips is important since we're paving the way for the next set of earth loving adults.

          <p> I'd advise everyone to check the weather before you go. Every year we hear about the fires up in the foothills/mountains, knowing the current condition of a trail is essential. 2019 I noticed multiple campsites and trails were closed due to rotting/dying trees that could fall over any moment.   Wearing the right shoes and clothes can either make it a pleasant experience or a miserable trip.  
            I find it useful to calculate the estimated time that the hike might take. I definitely take into consideration the weather, who is with me and what our average pace looks like. My hiking group ages range from 5 years old to 75 years old. We take long breaks and it gives us the opportunity to admire the landscape, stay hydrated and enjoy a little snack. <br>My prefered app to us is Alltrails, my favorite part is the recent updates from current hikers. you can upload pictures, comments and notes. This app deliver much needed insight to upcoming trips. Download it, make an account and start planning your next adventure.

        <article class="frame">Hiking etiquette summed up in one simple video below. I like to think that hiking is ultimately a self-serving endeavor, we must be conscientious of how our actions impact the trail and others who seek to enjoy it. The importance of leaving no trace is such a profound statement. So please remember pack in, pack out.
